# SendMessage Hanging Issue - Investigation Memory

## Current Status: ACTIVE INVESTIGATION
**Date Created:** 2025-07-24  
**Issue:** SendMessage API hangs indefinitely on VPS, works locally  
**Session ID:** 7afd5398-97c3-11eb-a990-f23c917564d6  
**Test JID:** 351931652836@s.whatsapp.net  

## Todo List Progress

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS
1. **Analyze recent commit history for breaking changes** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Identified problematic commits in Baileys core (Oct 2024)
   - Found significant socket refactoring changes
   
2. **Review WhatsAppServiceV2 changes that could cause hanging** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Confirmed SendMessage method has proper logging fix applied
   - CRM integration present but not the primary cause (single user testing)
   
3. **Check for potential race conditions or blocking operations** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Found fire-and-forget CRM tasks but volume is low during testing
   - Identified core socket changes as more likely culprit
   
4. **Identify differences between working and current state** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Works locally, fails on VPS = environmental exposure of core bug
   - Session appears connected but SendMessage pipeline is broken

5. **Check for changes to Baileys core code that could break message sending** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **CRITICAL FINDING:** Major Baileys core refactoring in Oct 2024:
     - BaseSocket.cs: 72 deletions, 29 additions (commit d472add)
     - ChatSocket.cs: 41 deletions, 14 additions (commit 584c0e7)
     - MessagesRecvSocket.cs: 69 deletions, 46 additions (commit 288089a)

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS TASKS
6. **Verify if WhatsApp session is truly functional despite appearing connected** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Session shows "connected successfully" in logs
   - BUT: SendMessage hangs, session status endpoint hangs
   - CONCLUSION: Session appears connected but core functionality is broken

### ‚è≥ PENDING TASKS
7. **Create feature branch for Baileys core revert testing** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **NEXT ACTION:** Create `feature/revert-baileys-core-for-testing` branch
   - Preserve all WhatsAppApi improvements while testing core fixes

8. **Revert Baileys core socket changes (BaseSocket, ChatSocket, MessagesRecvSocket)** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Target commits: d472add, 584c0e7, 288089a
   - Revert to state before October 2024 socket refactoring

9. **Verify WhatsAppApi compatibility with reverted Baileys core** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Ensure WhatsAppServiceV2 still works with older Baileys interface
   - Check for any breaking API changes

10. **Test SendMessage functionality on reverted code** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
    - Test with same session: 7afd5398-97c3-11eb-a990-f23c917564d6
    - Test with same JID: 351931652836@s.whatsapp.net
    - Compare local vs VPS behavior

## Key Findings & Evidence

### üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
**Primary Suspect:** Baileys core socket refactoring (Oct 2024)
- Major changes to message sending infrastructure
- Likely introduced environment-specific bugs
- Explains why local works but VPS fails

**Secondary Factors:**
- VPS environment exposes bugs that local environment masks
- Network latency/conditions on VPS trigger the hanging behavior
- Session management appears functional but message pipeline is broken

### üìä Evidence Supporting Core Bug Theory
1. **Timing:** Issues started after core socket changes
2. **Environment:** Works locally (masks bug) vs VPS (exposes bug)  
3. **Symptoms:** Session connects but SendMessage hangs
4. **Scope:** Multiple endpoints hang (SendMessage, session status)
5. **Pattern:** Hanging specifically on message-related operations

### üö´ RULED OUT CAUSES
- **CRM resource exhaustion:** Only single user testing
- **SendMessage async/sync changes:** Method was always async
- **Recent logging fixes:** Already applied correctly
- **Session volume issues:** Minimal usage during testing

## Technical Details

### üîß Current SendMessage Implementation (WORKING)
```csharp
public async Task SendMessage(string sessionName, string remoteJid, string message)
{
    if (_sessions.TryGetValue(sessionName, out var sessionData))
    {
        await sessionData.Socket.SendMessage(remoteJid, new TextMessageContent()
        {
            Text = message
        });
        sessionData.LastActivity = DateTime.UtcNow;
    }
    else
    {
        throw new Exception($"Session {sessionName} not found.");
    }
}
```

### üî¥ Problem Point
- Hangs at: `await sessionData.Socket.SendMessage()`
- This calls into Baileys core MessagesSendSocket.cs
- Core socket implementation was heavily refactored

### üåê Environment Differences
- **Local:** Fast network, development setup, different resource constraints
- **VPS:** Production network, potential firewall/proxy, different timeout behaviors

## Next Actions Required

1. **Create feature branch** for safe testing
2. **Revert core socket changes** to pre-October state  
3. **Test reverted version** on both local and VPS
4. **If fix works:** Identify specific problematic changes in core
5. **If fix fails:** Investigate other environmental factors

## Commit References
- **Problematic Commits:**
  - d472add: Update BaseSocket.cs
  - 584c0e7: Update ChatSocket.cs  
  - 288089a: Update MessagesRecvSocket.cs
- **Working Commits:**
  - 7ca75ee: SendMessage logging fix (KEEP)
  - All WhatsAppServiceV2 improvements (KEEP)

## Test Configuration
- **Session:** 7afd5398-97c3-11eb-a990-f23c917564d6
- **Test JID:** 351931652836@s.whatsapp.net
- **VPS URL:** http://whatsapp.rubymanager.app/v2/WhatsAppControllerV2/sendMessage
- **Expected Behavior:** Should complete within 5-10 seconds, not hang indefinitely
